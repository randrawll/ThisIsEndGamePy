#### Description: A simple top down shooter Zelda-esque style game made with pygame

# What This Project Is:
I choose to make a game using Python. I choose to use the Pygame library, as well as the Pytmx library for Tiled map integration. The game is a simple top-down shooter in the Zelda-esque style. In the game you take on the role of the Debug Duck in a battle to thwart evil AI bugs and save the world. The are three total levels, unique enemies, a familiar boss, background music, sound effects, menu screens, a story, and more! It had always been a dream of mine to start and finish a game, and this is the first time that I have accomplished that! Albeit small, it very much feels like an accomplishment to me.

# The Process:
When I first set out to start this project, I started with Love2D. After making some progress with that, I realized that I really just wanted to work with Python instead. From there I found a great Youtube tutorial (KidsCanCode - https://youtu.be/Rx5TjaVW__8) to follow and picked up the basics of the Pygame library. From there it was coming up with a game idea and how to implement it. The game design and features started out much grander that what the projects resulted in. This is because I quickly learned that making a game is extremely time consuming, and time is a limited resource! I packed in as much as I could, knowing that I wanted to complete this project before years end. The end result is what you have here, and I am indeed rather proud of it!
